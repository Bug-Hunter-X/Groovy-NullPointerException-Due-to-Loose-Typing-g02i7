# Groovy NullPointerException Example

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to null pointer exceptions that can arise from the language's dynamic typing.  The `bug.groovy` file shows a simple method that doesn't explicitly handle null input, leading to potential `NullPointerExceptions`. The solution demonstrates a safe way to prevent these exceptions.
